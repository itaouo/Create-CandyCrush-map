# Create-CandyCrush-map
Use opencv-python to scan CandyCrush maps

## Motivation
To provide [OOPL_CandyCrush](https://github.com/itaouo/OOPL_CandyCrush) project with a lot of maps, I made this project to simulate the original game and convert the map to .txt files.

## Usage
1. screenshot CandyCrush game screen
2. put image in assets/map/
3. execute **capture.py** and **transform.py**
4. get .txt files in **outputs/init_map/** and **outputs/init_map/**
5. end!
